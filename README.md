# About

To help people overcome this lack of communication during and after the pandemic. Unfold is a healing community for you to safely express yourself, help and get help, and get to know your pen pal, through the means of anonymous letters and chatting.

## Why different compare to the traditional therapy?
An artificial intelligence-based recommendation system is used in our application. It actively measures the user's emotions while typing and thus ensures a positive response by changing the recommended content using supervised learning. Traditional/existing psychological therapies have no way to measure and validate of the effectiveness of treatment used.

## Here's how this app works.
### 1. Express Feeling
Does your mind fall apart from time to time? Do you have trouble opening up to people? Write a letter about what's bothering you and send it out. There will be a warm soul waiting to cheer you up or warm someone else with your soul.

### 2. AI Evaluation & Guidance
Understand your mood by chatting with the AI, which is not just your buddy, but also automatically assesses your mental state and provides appropriate advice through the conversation. As the AI becomes more familiar with you, the greater the likelihood that you will receive the “right” letter.

### 3. Pen pal & Hugs
Building friendships by sending out positive energy. Only the worth ones deserves a place in limited mailbox capacity. Each day there will be three anonymous letter delivered to your home, you can choose to reply or give it a hug, a positive energy report will be generated weekly and you can see the positive energy sent and received.
